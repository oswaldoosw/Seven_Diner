## Program Flow
The Entity-Control-Boundary pattern is used here. So, the Boundary (EJS) usually has a form that does a POST or a GET request to a route (e.g. /Login). This time, I will explain tasks related to POST requests, which are used to send data to the Controller. The index.js file contains all routes, and each of them calls a function inside a Controller (Express.js). The Controller receives the data sent through the POST request through the use of req.body. Then, the Controller sends the data to the Entity (Express.js and MySQL), where it executes database-related tasks (MySQL). Finally, the Entity passes data inside the callback function's parameter and executes the callback function, which is located in the Controller to do a task, usually to display a new page while passing data to the EJS.

Please refer to the Sequence Diagram for user login below for an illustration of the Entity-Control-Boundary pattern.
